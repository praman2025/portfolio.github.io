        <h1>Smart Parking System Across the City</h1>
        <p>
            Why do we use Kruskals/Dijkstra's algorithm for this?
        </p><br>
        <p1>
            Kruskal's Algorithm is used to construct an MST(Minimum Spanning Tree) for the Transportation Network. So we can either determine the most efficient route lines for transportation. We use Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path to travel.
        </p1>
        <p>Why Use Hash for this parking system?</p>
        <p1>
            For Locating Parking Spot Availability. Hash will help in efficient storage and retrieval of which parking spots are in use and which are empty to redirect people to the correct parking spots.
