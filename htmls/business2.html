            Why do we use Dijkstra's algorithm for this?
        </p><br>
        <p1>
            We use Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path to travel for the emergency routes.
        </p1>
        <p>Why Use Bellman-Ford Algorithm for this emergency system?</p>
        <p1>
            Unlike Dijsktra's Algorithm Bellman-Ford can handle negative weights which account for road closures, traffic etc. It also finds the shortest path to the destination from a single source.
        </p1>
        <p>
            Why use Floyd-Warshell for this emergency response system?
        </p>
        <p1>
            It can be used for a city-wide route optimization.If the system needs to quickly find the shortest path between any two locations (e.g., fire stations, hospitals, accident sites), Floyd-Warshall can precompute these paths and store them in a lookup table.
